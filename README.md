# CustomerSegmentation

This project is a part of my study and road to become a data scientist. The data was collected from Kaggle but the link has been deleted. The data is now avaiable in this repository
#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The primary objective of this project was to segment customers of an online retail store using the RFM method. The RFM method is a customer segmentation technique that clusters customers based on their recency (time since last transaction), frequency, and monetary value.

Recency measures how recently a customer has made a purchase. Frequency measures how often a customer makes a purchase. Monetary value measures the total amount of money a customer has spent.

By segmenting customers based on these three factors, businesses can gain insights into their customer base and develop targeted marketing campaigns.

### Methods Used
This project used the following methods and techniques:

* Statistical analysis to calculate the RFM scores for each customer
* Data visualization to create plots and help understand customers
* Manually defined clusters based on the RFM scores
* Machine learning to cluster the customers based on the data and to compare the results

### Technologies
* Python
* Visual Studio Code
* Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn, datetime


## Project Overview

This project identified five customer segments based on their RFM scores. The clusters were defined manually by setting thresholds for each RFM metric.

**Approach:**

* Data was collected from Kaggle
* RFM scores were calculated after a research and the weights used were: 15% recency, 30% frequency, 55% monetary
* Clusters were defined based on those final scores

**Results:**

The five customer segments were defined as follows:

* **Top:** Customers with a RFM score of 4.5 or higher
* **High value:** Customers with a RFM score of 4 to 4.49
* **Medium value:** Customers with a RFM score of 3 to 3.99
* **Low value:** Customers with a RFM score of 1.6 to 2.99
* **Lost customers:** Customers with a RFM score of 1.5 or lower


## Needs of this project
* Data analysis/visualization: To understand the customer data and identify patterns and trends.
* Data preprocessing: To clean and prepare the data for analysis.
* Statistical modeling: To cluster the customers and develop predictive models.
* Writeup/reporting: To communicate the findings of the project in a clear and concise manner.
* Programming in Python
* Experience with data science tools and libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
